## Requirements

-   Microsoft Azure subscription (non-Microsoft subscription).

-   **Global Administrator role** for Azure AD within your subscription.

-   Local machine or a virtual machine configured with (**Complete the day before the lab!**):

    -   Visual Studio Community 2017 or greater

    -   Visual Studio 2017 workloads for:

        -   Azure development

        -   Mobile development with .NET

    -   SQL Server 2017 Express or greater

    -   SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

    -   PowerShell 1.1.0 or higher


## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all steps provided *before* attending the hands-on lab.

>**IMPORTANT:** Most Azure resources require unique names. Throughout this lab you will see the word "SUFFIX" as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the resource is uniquely named.

### Task 1: Provision a resource group

In this task, you will create an Azure resource group for the resources used throughout this lab.

1.  In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Resource groups**, select **+Add**, then enter the following in the Create an empty resource group blade:

    a.  **Name**: Enter hands-on-lab-SUFFIX.

    b.  **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

    c.  **Resource group location**: Select a nearby location. Remember this location for other resources in this hands-on lab.
    
    ![Resource groups is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, + Add is highlighted in the Resource groups blade, and \"hands-on-labs\" is entered into the Resource group name textbox on the Resource Group, Create an empty resource group blade.](media/b4-image3.png "Azure portal Add Resource group")

2.  Select **Create**.

### Task 2: Create a development virtual machine

In this task, you will provision an Azure virtual machine (VM) using the Visual Studio Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 (x64) image. This will be used as your development machine throughout this lab. If you already have a machine running Visual Studio Community 2017 (or later) and would like to use it as your development machine, you can skip this task.

It is recommended you use a DS2 or D2 instance size for this VM. If you decide to use a VM, you will not be able to run the Android emulator in later steps of the lab.

1.  In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **+Create a resource**, enter "Visual Studio" into the Search the Marketplace box, and select **Visual Studio Community 2017 (latest release) on Windows Server 2016 (x64)** from the results. 

    ![In the Azure Portal Everything section, under Results, under Name, Visual Studio Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 is circled.](media/b4-image4.png "Azure Portal Everything section")

2.  On the blade that comes up, at the bottom, ensure the deployment model is set to Resource Manager, and select **Create**.

    ![At the Bottom of the blade, Resource Manager is selected as the deployment model.](media/b4-image5.png "Bottom of the blade")

3.  Set the following configuration on the Basics tab:

    a.  **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

    b.  **Resource Group**: Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.
    
    c.  **Name**: Enter LabVM

    d.  **Image**: Ensure **Visual Studio Community 2017 (latest release) on Windows Server 2016 (x64)** is selected.

    e.  **Username**: demouser

    f.  **Password**: Enter Password.1!!

4. Select **Change Size** and choose D2s_v3.

  !["D2s_v3 is highlighted in the list of available sizes"](media/b4-image7.png "Select VM Size")

5.  On the Settings blade, locate the **Select public inbound ports** drop down, and select **RDP (3389)**     
    ![Create virtual machine basics blade with values specified above enter into the fields](media/create-labvm-resource.png "Create virtual machine basics blade")
    
6.  Select **Next : Disks >** to move to the next step.

7.  Select **Premium SSD** as the OS Disk type.

8.  Select **Review + create** to move on to the Validation step.

9.  After Validation is complete, select **Create** on the Create blade to provision the virtual machine.

10. It may take 10+ minutes for the virtual machine to complete provisioning.
