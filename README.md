The following labs will be provided.  To make the day run smoothly it is *IMPORTANT* that you choose one (or more) of the labs below and work through the Pre-Requisites provided.   This will ensure you have the necessary tools, Azure access, and other infrastructure set up prior to starting the actual lab.  Prior to the event we will distribute the step-by-step instructions for each lab electronically (they will not be provided in printed form).

## Legacy App Modernization

In this workshop, you will gain a better understanding on the steps involved in modernizing legacy on-premises applications and infrastructure by leveraging cloud services, while adding a mix of web and mobile services, all secured using Azure Active Directory.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to design a modernization plan for organizations looking to move services from on-premises to the cloud.

## Continuous Delivery in Azure DevOps

In this workshop, you will learn how to setup and configure continuous delivery within Azure using a combination of Azure Resource Manager templates and Azure DevOps. You will do this throughout the use of a new Azure DevOps project, Git repository for source control, and an Azure Resource Manager template for Azure resource deployment and configuration management.

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to build templates to automate cloud infrastructure and reduce error-prone manual processes. In addition, you'll create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to provision Azure resources, configure continuous delivery with Azure DevOps, configure Application Insights into an application, and create an Azure DevOps project and Git repository.

## Containers and DevOps

In this workshop, you will build a proof of concept (POC) that will transform an existing PaaS application to a container-based application. This POC will deliver a multi-tenant web app hosting solution leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Docker containers on Linux nodes, and a migration from MongoDB to CosmosDB.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to improve the reliability of and increase the release cadence of your container-based applications through time-tested DevOps practices.
